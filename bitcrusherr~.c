//  This file implements a Pd external to perform a "bit crush"
//  audio effect by reducing the effective sampling rate of the incoming
//  audio signal.
//  The first (left) inlet is the audio signal
//  (thus the tilde naming, per typical Pd naming convention).
//  The second (right) inlet is the number of reduction factor, which indicates how
//  how many samples to repeat in a row.

//  One can think of this Pd external as performing a "horizontal" reduction of possible values
//  on an audio waveform, where the waveform has time on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis.
